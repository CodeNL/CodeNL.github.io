        <span>Canada is forecast to need an extra 180,000 information, communications, and technology workers by 2019. However, nine out of ten schools don't even offer computer programming classes. Let's fix that.</span>

            We believe that every student should be exposed to computer science. We all use computers every day — whether they are cell phones, laptops, or desktops. Every student should have the chance to experience the art and science of computer programming.

            <p>
              We lobby the provincial government to improve computer programming education in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Currently, the Newfoundland & Labrador curriculum does not offer a set of courses — let alone one course — that provide a solid grounding in computer science skills. The courses currently offered in the curriculum contain nothing more than a cursory overview to the subject. Courses in Newfoundland and Labrador are treated as distinct entities. There is no logical sequence. For example, Integrated Systems 1205 isn’t necessarily an introduction to Robotics 3205. It’s a stand-alone course. 
              <br>
              We’re here to change this.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Don't Newfoundland and Labrador schools currently offer courses that teach computer science skills?</span>
            <p>If you look at Ontario’s curriculum, there are 5 “computer technology” courses offered in grades 10 through 12, as well as 5 courses specifically geared towards computer programming. Many of those courses are on a university or college level. Furthermore, these courses are offered in sequence, meaning that students get broad, continuous exposure to computer programming during their high school careers. This prepares them well for university studies in computer science.
<br>
In contrast, courses in Newfoundland are treated as distinct entities. There is no logical sequence. For example, Integrated Systems 1205 isn’t necessarily an introduction to Robotics 3205. It’s a stand-alone course.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Do other regions of the world teach computer science in schools?</span>
            <p>
              Many countries already teach computer science in some form to students from an early age.
              <br>
              England is the first country in the world to mandate computer programming in primary and secondary schools. Children start learning computer programming at age five, and continue learning until age 16.
              <br>    
              Around 2000, Israel performed a major review of computer education at schools , and now has the most rigorous computer science high school programme in the world.
              <br>
              At all levels of school in South Korea, the curriculum contains a large amount of computer programming education.
              <br>
              In 2013,  Harvard’s Education Magazine released a list of 30 ideas that will revolutionize education. Teaching computer programming was one of them. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Isn't computer programming expensive to teach?</span>
            <p>
              Yes, skilled computer scientists demand high salaries. However, computer science is an investment in our childrens’ futures. Computer science is the new literacy, and is a vital skill for the digital age. It is difficult to put a price on the value of education.
              <br>
              By teaching all children to code, the knowledge economy will reap huge returns in the years to come.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>How can I help improve computer programming education in Canada?</span>
            <p>
              If you feel that computer programming is an important skill for the next generation, please reach out to your local legislative representative, or the Minister of Education in your province.

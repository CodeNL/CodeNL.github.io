  Currently, the Newfoundland & Labrador curriculum does not offer a set of courses — let alone one course — that provide a solid grounding in computer science skills. The courses currently offered in the curriculum contain nothing more than a cursory overview to the subject. Courses in Newfoundland and Labrador are treated as distinct entities. There is no logical sequence. For example, Integrated Systems 1205 isn’t necessarily an introduction to Robotics 3205. It’s a stand-alone course.

                  If you look at Ontario’s curriculum, there are 5 “computer technology” courses offered in grades 10 through 12, as well as 5 courses specifically geared towards computer programming. Many of those courses are on a university or college level. Furthermore, these courses are offered in sequence, meaning that students get broad, continuous exposure to computer programming during their high school careers. This prepares them well for university studies in computer science.

            A Code Club is a regular meeting place where you can learn how to write code. Everyone is welcome to attend — both kids and adults!

            <p>
The event is completely free - the only requirement is that kids below the age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
For those of you with laptops, we'd encourage you to bring them along. But don't worry, they are not required - there are plenty of computers available here to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Code Club takes place every two weeks on Sunday, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. It is held in the Computing Services building at Memorial University, in room CS-1019.
            </p>
            <p>
The Computing Services building is the small "temporary" building west of the Science building - number 16 on <a href="http://www.mun.ca/campus_map/stjohns/campusmap2015.pdf" title="MUN campus map">the MUN campus map</a>.
